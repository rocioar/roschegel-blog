I'm Rocio Aramberri. I live in Brazil, but I'm originally from Uruguay.

I work remotely as a Lead Engineer at [BriteCore](https://britecore.com). I'm a constant learner with a passion for Software Design. My main areas of expertise are Django, VueJS, and AWS.

I enjoy writing about Python, Django, and testing.
