I'm Rocio Aramberri, I live in Brazil, but I'm originally from Uruguay.

I work as a Senior Engineer in the Identity team at [Zapier](https://zapier.com). Iâ€™m a constant learner with a passion for Software Design.

In this blog you will see posts about Python, Django, and testing. I'll probably also dig into some AWS topics in the future.
